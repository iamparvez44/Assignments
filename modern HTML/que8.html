          markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure
          of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements
          tell the browser how to display the content.

        <p>
          A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser
          and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: &lt;div&gt; and
          &lt;span&gt; - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic
          elements: &lt;form&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; - Clearly
          defines its content. <br />

        <h1>what is form element in html ? explain.</h1>
        <p>
          An HTML form is a section of a document which contains controls such
          as text fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit
          button, menus etc. An HTML form facilitates the user to enter data
          that is to be sent to the server for processing such as name, email
          address, password, phone number, etc. . <br />
          HTML forms are required if you want to collect some data from of the
          site visitor. For example: If a user want to purchase some items on
          internet, he/she must fill the form such as shipping address and
          credit/debit card details so that item can be sent to the given
          address. <br />
