      Google Fonts is a library of 1513 open source font families and APIs for
      convenient use via CSS and Android. The library also has delightful and
      beautifully crafted icons for common actions and items. Download them for
      use in your digital products for Android, iOS, and web. Our font catalog
      places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and
      test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type
      designers and foundries, giving you valuable information about the
      typographers and their process, as well as analytics on usage and
      demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you discover new
      fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of designers,
      engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes fonts based
      on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can also create
      your own highly customized collections by filtering families, weights, and
      scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy. Collections can
      be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography
      is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and engineering
      process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog, expanding
      expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the Material
      iconsâ€”delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common communication
      needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital products for
      Android, iOS, and web.
